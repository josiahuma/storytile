<p>Your alarm rings out loud at 5:30am in the morning of Monday. You are still drowsy with sleep and really tired from coming home late last night after a birthday party you attended. As the alarm continues to ring all you can think about is the dream you were having some miutes ago.</p>
<p> Do you:
<a href="snooze.html">Snooze the alarm for another 30 mins and continue sleeping?</a> or
<a href="wake.html">Wake up at once and begin to prepare for the day</a>
