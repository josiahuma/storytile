<p>Your alarm fails to ring at 6:00 and unfortuntely you do not wake up until 6:30. "This is devastating!" you cry as you hurry out of the bed
to freshen up for work. It's going to take you another 2 and a half hours to get to the office, thanks to Lagos traffic. You try to make it out of the house on time to get to the bus stop 5 mins away from your house. When you get to the bus stop, you sight a conductor beconing for passengers to Ogbalende/CMS but just before you could get to the bus, you also notice a salon vehicle parked right beside you and the driver is also asking for passengers to VI which is where your office is located. You think to yourself "I am already running late, I need to use the fastest means to work"</p>

<p>Do you:</p>
<a href="">Join the Bus to ogbalende</a> or <a href="">Join the vehicle to VI</a>?
